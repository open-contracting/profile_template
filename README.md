# OCDS for TODO

## Getting started

1. [Download a ZIP file version of the template](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template/archive/master.zip)
1. Extract it, and initialise it as a git repository (`git init`)
1. Replace `TODO` in `.travis.yml`, `docs/conf.py`, `docs/index.md`, `schema/profile/extension.json` and this file
1. Update and prepare any files
1. Commit the files you added or changed
1. Delete `.keep` files once new files are added to those directories (see below)
1. In `.travis.yml`, set `LANGS` to a comma-separated list of the languages in which the content is available
1. Push to a new public Git repository
1. [Configure robots.txt to allow access to the profile's documentation](https://ocdsdeploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/docs.html#add-a-new-profile)
1. [Configure Travis to push builds to the staging server](https://ocdsdeploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/docs.html#publish-draft-documentation)

```shell
git rm docs/locale/.keep
git commit -am "Remove dummy files"
```

### Updating build-related files

Periodically update the stable files across the standard and profiles:

```shell
./script/update
```

Periodically compare the configurable files to the template's files:

```shell
./script/diff
```
