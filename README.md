# OCDS for TODO

## Getting started

1. [Download a ZIP file version of the template](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template/archive/master.zip)
1. Extract it, and initialise it as a git repository (`git init`)
1. Replace `TODO` in `docs/conf.py`, `docs/index.md`, `docs/_templates/layout.html`, `schema/profile/extension.json` and this file
1. Update and prepare any files
1. Commit the files you added or changed
1. Delete `.keep` files once new files are added to those directories (see below)
1. Push to a new public Git repository

```shell
git rm docs/_static/.keep locale/.keep
git commit -am "Remove dummy files"
```

### Updating build-related files

Periodically update the following files across the standard and profiles:

```shell
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template/master/common-requirements.txt
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template/master/Makefile
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template/master/include/common.mk -o include/common.mk
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template/master/include/prologue.mk -o include/prologue.mk
```

Periodically update the following files across profiles:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template/master/schema/build-profile.py -o schema/build-profile.py
```

Periodically compare the configurable files to the template's files:

* <https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template/blob/master/.travis.yml>
* <https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template/blob/master/docs/conf.py>
* <https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template/blob/master/include/config.mk>
